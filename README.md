### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pauline!
ðŸ”­ I have recently finished my PhD in cognitive science and am currently working as a project manager. <br />
ðŸ’¬ I have had different types of jobs in the past (research, project management, marketing, teaching),
   and they have all had a common theme: Communicating!<br />
ðŸ˜„ I am currently looking for a job that will allow me to communicate about one of my favourite things: Data! <br />
ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauline-cuperus/<br />
<br />
On this page, I will share some projects that I have been working on:<br />
- Olympics: In this project, I explore data from all Olympic athletes since 1974 and create a Random Forest Classifier
  with 86% accuracy to classify whether athletes won a medal or not.<br />
- Gym_Visitors: Here I make recommendations to a (fictional) gym holder on how to improve marketing/promotion strategies
  for their campus gym and on how staffing at this gym can be optimised. I do this by looking particularly at the number of
  visitors periods throughout the day and year and additionally by using a K-Nearest Neighbors regressor and a Random Forest
  Regressor (r-squared = .93) to try to predict the number of visitors hourly at the gym.  <br />

More projects coming soon!
