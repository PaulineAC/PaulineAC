### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pauline!
ðŸ”­ I have recently finished my PhD in cognitive science and am currently working as a project manager. <br />
ðŸ’¬ I have had different types of jobs in the past (research, project management, marketing, teaching), <br />
   and they have all had a common theme: Communicating!<br />
ðŸ˜„ I am currently looking for a job that will allow me to communicate about one of my favourite things: Data! <br />
ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauline-cuperus/<br />
<br />
Here, I will share some projects that I have been working on:<br />
~ Olympics: In this project, I explore data from all Olympic athletes since 1974 and use a Random Forest Classifier <br />
  with 86% accuracy to classify whether athletes won a medal or not.
