### 👋 Hi, I'm Pauline!
🔭 I have recently finished my PhD in cognitive science and am currently working as a project manager. <br />
💬 I have had different types of jobs in the past (research, project management, marketing, teaching), <br />
   and they have all had a common theme: Communicating!<br />
😄 I am currently looking for a job that will allow me to communicate about one of my favourite things: Data! <br />
